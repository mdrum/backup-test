The industrial Phase B activities began in January 1991 under\nthe leadership of Aerospatiale, the Huygens prime contractor.\n \nThe Probe was carried to Titan by the Cassini Saturn Orbiter. Huygens\nwas dormant during the interplanetary journey of 6.7 years, although\nit was activated about every 6 months to verify and monitor its\nhealth. It was released 22 days before the Titan encounter. The\nProbe's aeroshell decelerated it in less than 3 min from the entry\nspeed of about 6 km/s to 400 m/s (Mach 1.5) by 150-180 km altitude.\nFrom that point onwards, a pre-programmed sequence triggered parachute\ndeployment and heatshield ejection. The main part of the scientific\nmission then started, lasting for the whole descent of 2-2.5 h. The\nHuygens model philosophy was optimised to achieve the most complete\nverification possible that the Probe system meets the mission\nrequirements within the cost envelope and the tight schedule\nconstraints imposed by the launch window. Four models were developed\nat system level:\n \n1. Structural, Thermal & Pyro Model (STPM): to qualify the Probe\ndesign (including all mechanisms activated by pyrotechnic devices) for\nall structural, mechanical and thermal requirements;\n \n2. Electrical Model (EM): to verify the electrical performances of the\nProbe and of the electrical/functional interfaces with the Orbiter;\n \n3. Special Model (SM2): used for the balloon drop test in May 1995.\nAll the mechanisms and the descent control systems were\nflight-standard;\n \n4. Flight Model (FM).\n \nOverall Configuration\n---------------------\n \nThe Probe System comprises two principal elements:\n \n1. the 318 kg Huygens Probe, which enters Titan's atmosphere after\n  separating from the Saturn Orbiter;\n \n2. the 30 kg Probe Support Equipment (PSE), which remains attached to\n  the Orbiter after Probe separation.\n \n \nThe Probe consists of the Entry Assembly (ENA) cocooning the Descent\nModule (DM). ENA provides Orbiter attachment, umbilical separation and\nejection, cruise and entry thermal protection, and entry deceleration\ncontrol. It is jettisoned after entry, releasing the Descent Module.\nThe DM comprises an aluminium shell and inner structure containing all\nthe experiments and Probe support subsystems, including the parachute\ndescent and spin control devices.\n \nThe PSE consists of:\n \n1. four electronic boxes aboard the Orbiter: two Probe Support\n  Avionics (PSA), a Receiver Front End (RFE) and a Receiver Ultra\n  Stable Oscillator (RUSO);\n \n2. the Spin Eject Device (SED);\n \n3. the harness (including the umbilical connector) providing power and\n  RF and data links between the PSA, Probe and Orbiter.\n \n \n \n \nFront Shield Subsystem (FRSS)\n-----------------------------\n \nThe 79 kg, 2.7 m diameter, 60 degree half-angle coni-spherical Front\nShield will decelerate the Probe in Titan's upper atmosphere from\nabout 6 km/s at entry to a velocity equivalent to about Mach 1.5 by\naround 160 km altitude. Tiles of AQ60 ablative material, a felt of\nsilica fibres reinforced by phenolic resin, provide protection against\nthe 1 MW/m2 thermal flux. The shield is then jettisoned and the\nDescent Control Subsystem (DCSS) is deployed to control the descent of\nthe DM to the surface.\nThe FRSS supporting structure is a CFRP honeycomb shell which also\nprovides some DM thermal protection during entry. The AQ60 tiles are\nattached to the CFRP structure by adhesive CAF/730. Prosial, a\nsuspension of hollow silica spheres in silicon elastomer, is sprayed\ndirectly on to the aluminium structure of the FRSS rear surfaces,\nwhere fluxes are ten times lower.\n \nBack Cover Subsystem (BCSS)\n---------------------------\n \nThe Back Cover protects the DM during entry, ensures depressurisation\nduring launch and carries multi-layer insulation (MLI) for the cruise\nand coast phases. As it does not have stringent aerothermodynamic\nrequirements, it is a stiffened aluminium shell of minimal mass (11.4\nkg) protected by Prosial (5 kg). It includes: an access door for late\nintegration and forced-air ground cooling of the Probe; a break-out\npatch through which the first (drogue) parachute is fired; a labyrinth\nsealing joint with the Front Shield, providing a non-structural\nthermal and particulate barrier.\n \nDescent Control Subsystem (DCSS)\n--------------------------------\n \nThe DCSS controls the descent rate to satisfy the scientific payload's\nrequirements, and the attitude to meet the requirements of the Probe-\nOrhbiter RF data link and of the descent camera's image-taking.\nThe DCSS is activated nominally at Mach 1.5 and about 160 km altitude.\nThe sequence begins by firing the Parachute Deployment Device (PDD) to\neject the pilot 'chute pack through the Back Cover's break-out patch,\nthe attachment pins of which shear under the impact. The 2.59 m\ndiameter Disk Gap Band (DGB) pilot 'chute inflates 27 m behind the DM\nand pulls the Back Cover away from the rest of the assembly. As it\ngoes, the Back Cover pulls the 8.30 m diameter DGB main parachute from\nits container. This canopy inflates during the supersonic phase to\ndecelerate and stabilise the Probe through the transonic region. The\nFront Shield is released at about Mach 0.6. In fact, the main\nparachute is sized by the requirement to provide sufficient\ndeceleration to guarantee a positive separation of the Front Shield\nfrom the Descent Module.\nThe main parachute is too large for a nominal descent time shorter\nthan 2.5 h, a constraint imposed by battery limitations, so it is\njettisoned and a 3.03 m diameter DGB stabilising parachute is\ndeployed. All parachutes are made of Kevlar lines and nylon fabric.\nThe main and stabiliser 'chutes are housed in a single canister on the\nDM's top platform. Compatibility with the Probe's spin is ensured by\nincorporating a swivel using redundant low-friction bearings in the\nconnecting riser of both the main and stabiliser 'chutes.\n \nSeparation Subsystem (SEPS)\n---------------------------\n \nSEPS provides: mechanical and electrical attachment to, and separation\nfrom the Orbiter; the transition between the entry configuration\n('cocoon') and the descent configuration (DM under parachute). The\nthree SEPS mechanisms are connected on one side to Huygens' Inner\nStructure (ISTS) and on the other to the Orbiter's supporting struts.\nAs well as being the Probe-Orbiter structural load path, each SEPS\nfitting incorporates a pyronut for Probe-Orbiter separation, a rod\ncutter for Front Shield release and a rod cutter for Back Cover\nrelease.\n \nWithin SEPS, the Spin Eject Device (SED) performs the mechanical\nseparation from the Orbiter:\n \n- three stainless steel springs provide the separation force\n- three guide devices, each with two axial rollers running along a\n  T-profile helical track, ensure controlled ejection and spin, even\n  in degraded cases such as high friction or a weak spring\n- a carbon fibre ring accommodates the asymmetrical loads from the\n  Orbiter truss and provides the necessary stiffness before and after\n  separation\n- three pyronuts provide the mechanical link before separation.\n \nIn addition, the Umbilical Separation Mechanism of three 19-pin\nconnectors, which provide Orbiter-Probe electrical links, is\ndisconnected by the SED.\n \nInner Structure Subsystem (ISTS)\n--------------------------------\n \nThe ISTS provides mounting support for the Probe's payload and\nsubsystems. It is fully sealed except for a vent hole of about 6 cm2\non the top, and comprises:\n \n- the 73 mm thick aluminium honeycomb sandwich Experiment Platform;\n  supports the majority of the experiments and subsystems units,\n  together with their associated harness\n- the 25 mm thick aluminium honeycomb sandwich Top Platform; supports\n  the Descent Control Subsystem and Probe RF antennas, and forms the\n  DM's top external surface\n- the After Cone and Fore Dome aluminium shells, linked by a central\n  ring\n- three radial titanium struts; interface with SEPS and ensure thermal\n  decoupling, while three vertical titanium struts link the two\n  platforms and transfer the main parachute deployment loads\n- 36 spin vanes on the Fore Dome's periphery; provide spin control\n  during descent\n- the secondary structure; for mounting experiments and equipment.\n \nThermal Subsystem (THSS)\n------------------------\n \nWhile the PSE is thermally controlled by the Orbiter, the Probe's THSS\nmust maintain all experiments and subsystem units within their allowed\ntemperature ranges during all mission phases. In space, the THSS\npartially insulates the Probe from the Orbiter and ensures only small\nvariations in the Probe's internal temperatures, despite the incident\nsolar flux varying from 3800 W/m2 (near Venus) to 17 W/m2 (approaching\nTitan after 22 days of the coast phase following Orbiter separation).\nProbe thermal control is achieved by:\n- MLI surrounding all external areas, except for the small 'thermal\n  window' of the Front Shield\n- 35 Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs) on the Experiment and Top\n  Platforms continuously providing about 1 W each even when the Probe\n  is dormant\n- a white-painted 0.17 m2 thin aluminium sheet on the Front Shield's\n  forward face acting as a controlled heat leak (about 8 W during\n  cruise) to reduce sensitivity of thermal performances to MLI\n  efficiency.\n \nThe MLI is burned and torn away during entry, leaving temperature\ncontrol to the AQ60 high-temperature tiles on the Front Shield's front\nface, and to Prosial on the Front Shield's aft surface and on the Back\nCover.\nDuring the descent phase, thermal control is provided by foam\ninsulation and gas-tight seals. Lightweight open-cell Basotect foam\ncovers the internal walls of DM's shells and Top Platform. This\nprevents convection cooling by Titan's cold atmosphere (70 K at 45 km\naltitude) and thermally decouples the units mounted on the Experiment\nPlatform from the cold aluminium shells. Gas-tight seals around all\nelements protruding through the DM's shell minimise gas influx. In\nfact, the DM is gas tight except for a single 6 cm2 hole in Top\nPlatform that equalises pressure during launch and descent to Titan's\nsurface.\n \nElectrical Power Subsystem (EPSS)\n=================================\n \nDescription\n-----------\n \nThe EPSS consists of:\n \n- Five batteries: Provide mission power from Orbiter separation until\n  at least 30 min after arrival on Titan's surface. Each battery\n  comprises two modules of 13 LiSO2 (7.6 Ah) cells in series.\n- Power Conditioning & Distribution Unit (PCDU): Provides the power\n  conditioning and distribution to the Probe's equipment and\n  experiments via a regulated main bus, with protection to ensure\n  uninterrupted operations even in the event of single failure inside\n  or outside the PCDU.\n  During the cruise phase, the Probe is powered by the Orbiter and the\n  PCDU isolates the batteries. The five interface circuits connected\n  to the Orbiter's Solid State Power Switches (SSPSs) provide Probe-\n  Orbiter insulation and voltage adaptation between the SSPS output\n  and the input of the PCDU's Battery Discharge Regulator (BDR)\n  circuits. The BDRs condition the power from either the Orbiter or\n  the batteries and generate the 28 V bus, controlled by a centralised\n  Main Error Amplifier (MEA). The distribution is performed by active\n  current limiters, with the current limitation adapted for each user\n  and with ON/OFF switching capability. The Mission Timer, however, is\n  supplied by three switchable battery voltage lines through series\n  fuses or, when the PCDU is powered by the Orbiter, by dedicated\n  output voltage lines of the Orbiter interface circuits.\n  The PCDU also provides a protected +5 V supply used by the Pyro unit\n  to generate the bi-level status telemetry of the selection relays\n  and for the activation circuit that switches ON the Pyro unit's\n  energy intercept relay.\n- Pyro Unit (PYRO): Provides two redundant sets of 13 pyro lines,\n  directly connected to the centre taps of two batteries (through\n  protection devices), for activating pyro devices. Safety\n  requirements are met by three independent levels of control relays\n  in series in the Pyro Unit, as well as active switches and current\n  limiters controlling the firing current. The three series relay\n  levels are: energy intercept relay (activated by PCDU at the end of\n  the coast phase); arming relays (activated by the arming timer\n  hardware); selection relays (activated by Command and Data\n  Management Unit, CDMU, software). In addition, safe/arm plugs are\n  provided on the unit itself for ground operations.\n \nOperational modes\n-----------------\n \n- Cruise phase: The EPSS is completely OFF over the whole cruise\n  phase, except for periodic checkout operations. There is no power at\n  the Orbiter interface and direct monitoring by the Orbiter allows\n  verification that all the relays are open.\n- Cruise phase checkout: The EPSS is powered by the Orbiter for cruise\n  checkout operations. The 28 V bus is regulated by the EPSS BDRs\n  associated with each Orbiter SSPS; a total of 210 W is available\n  from the Orbiter and all the relays are open.\n- Timer loading: Following the loading (from the Orbiter) of the\n  correct coast time duration into the Mission Timer Unit, battery\n  depassivation is performed to overcome any energy loss due to ageing\n  during cruise. Before Probe separation, the EPSS timer relays are\n  closed to supply the Mission Timer from the batteries and the\n  Orbiter power is switched off.\n- Coast phase: Only the Mission Timer is supplied by batteries through\n  specific timer relays during the coast phase. The EPSS is OFF and\n  all other relays are open.\n- End of coast phase - Probe wake-up: At the end of the coast phase,\n  the Mission Timer wakes the Probe by activating the EPSS. Input\n  relays are closed and the current limiters powering the CDMU are\n  automatically switched ON as soon as the 28 V bus reaches its\n  nominal value (other current limiters are initially OFF at power\n  up). The pyro energy intercept relay is also automatically switched\n  on by a command from the PCDU.\n- Entry and descent phases: All PCDU relays are closed and the total\n  power (nominal 300 W, maximum 400 W) is available on the 28 V\n  distribution outputs to subsystems and equipment. The Pyro Unit\n  performs the selection and the firing of the squibs, activated by\n  CDMU commands.\n \nCommand & Data Management Subsystems (CDMS)\n===========================================\n \nThe data handling and processing functions are divided between the\nProbe Support Equipment (PSE) on the Orbiter and the CDMUs (part of\nthe CDMS) in the Probe. The Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS) provides\nthe RF link function for this purpose, together with the data handling\nand communication function with the Orbiter's Control and Data\nSubsystem (CDS) via a Bus Interface Unit (BIU). (During the ground\noperations and cruise phase checkouts, the Orbiter-Probe RF link is\nreplaced by umbilical connections.)\nThe CDMS has two primary functions: autonomous control of Probe\noperations after separation; management of data transfer from the\nequipment, subsystems and experiments to the Probe transmitter for\nrelay to the Orbiter. For these functions, the CDMS uses the Probe\nOn-board Software (POSW), for which it provides the necessary\nprocessing, storage and interface capabilities.\nThe driving requirement of the CDMS design is intrinsic single point\nfailure-tolerance. As a result of the highly specific Huygens mission\n(limited duration and no access by telecommand after separation), a\nvery safe redundancy scheme has been selected. The CDMS comprises:\n- two identical CDMUs\n- a triply redundant Mission Timer Unit (MTU)\n- two mechanical g-switches (backing up MTU)\n- a triply redundant Central Acceleration Sensor Unit (CASU)\n- two sets of two mechanical g-switches (backing up CASU)\n- a Radial Acceleration Sensor Unit (RASU) with two accelerometers\n- two Radar Altimeter proximity sensors, each comprising separate\n  electronics, transmit antenna and receive antenna\nThe two CDMUs each execute their own POSW simultaneously and are\nconfigured with hot redundancy (Chain A and Chain B). Each hardware\nchain can run the mission independently. They are identical in almost\nall respects; the following minor differences facilitate simultaneous\noperations and capitalise on the redundancy:\n- telemetry is transmitted at two different RF frequencies\n- chain B telemetry is delayed by about 6 s to avoid loss of data\n  should a temporary loss of the telemetry link occur (e.g. from an\n  antenna misalignment as the Probe oscillates beneath the parachute).\nEach CDMU chain incorporates a health check (called the Processor\nValid status) which is reported to the experiments in the Descent Data\nBroadcasts (DDBs). A chain declares itself invalid when two bit errors\nin the same memory word, an ADA exception or an under-voltage on the 5\nV line occur within the CDMU.\n \nCommand and Data Management Unit (CDMU)\n---------------------------------------\n \nEach CDMU includes a MAS 281 16-bit 1750A micro-processor running at\n10 MHz, with 64 kword PROM storing the POSW and 64 kword RAM used for\nthe POSW and other dynamic data when the CDMU is on. A Memory\nManagement Unit is implemented to provide memory flexibility and some\ngrowth potential. Direct Memory Access (DMA) is provided to facilitate\ndata transfer between the memory and the input/output registers, thus\nrelieving the microprocessor of repetitive input/output tasks. The\nRAM-stored program memory is protected against single error occurrence\nby an Error Detection And Correction (EDAC) device, which detects and\ncorrects single bit errors and reports any double bit errors to the\nProcessor Valid function.\nTM/TC management is based on an internal On-Board Data Handling (OBDH)\nbus in order to standardise the internal interfaces, which are based\non the classical Central Terminal Unit (CTU) and Remote Terminal Units\n(RTUs) approach.\nIn addition to conventional CDMS functions, the CDMUs implement the\nfollowing Huygens-specific functions:\n- the arming timer function sends pyro and arming commands following a\n  specific hardware-managed timeline, thus offering full decoupling\n  from the POSW operation\n- the Processor Valid signal is sent to experiments via the Descent\n  Data Broadcast (DDB), indicating the health of the nominal CDMU\n  (unit A)\n- reprogrammability through the use of 16 kword of Electrically\n  Erasable PROM (EEPROM), thus allowing patching of the POSW if\n  necessary\n- the EDAC error count reports on internal data transfers\n- the capability, through specific 16 kword of RAM, to delay one\n  telemetry chain.\n \nMission Timer Unit (MTU)\n------------------------\n \nThe MTU is used to activate the Probe at the end of the coast phase.\nTo obtain a single point failure-free design, it is based on three\nindependent hot redundant timer circuits followed by two hot-redundant\ncommand circuits. Two mechanical g-switches provide backup. MTU power\nis supplied directly via three 65 V supply lines, one for each Timer\nBoard, from independent batteries. During the pre-separation\nprogramming activities, when the Probe is still connected to the\nOrbiter, all three Timers are programmed with the exact duration of\nthe coast phase via serial memory load interfaces from one of the two\nCDMUs. Each of the three Timer Boards can be loaded independently from\neither CDMU. The programmed values can be verified by the serial\ntelemetry channels. When programming is finished, the CDMUs and all\nother Probe systems except the MTU are turned off and the Probe is\nseparated.\nDuring the coast phase of about 22 days, the programmed Timer register\nis decremented by a very precise clock signal. The MTU consumes about\n300 mW during this period as only the necessary circuits (CMOS-based)\nare powered. When the Command Board majority voting detects either\nboth g-switches active or at least two of the three 'time-out' signals\nreceived, five High Level Commands (HLCs) are issued sequentially from\neach Board to the PCDU in order to switch on both CDMUs. The timer\nthen returns to a standby mode.\nThe two g-switches, which ensure Probe wake-up in the event of\natmospheric entry without the time-out signal from any of the Timer\nboards, are purely mechanical devices closed when deceleration reaches\n5.5-6.5 g.\n \nCentral Acceleration Sensor Unit (CASU)\n---------------------------------------\n \nThe CASU measures axial deceleration at the centre of the Experiment\nPlatform during entry. The signal is processed by the CDMU to\ncalculate the time for parachute deployment (T0). The CASU operates\nwithin 0-10 g and uses a scale factor of 0.512 V/g. Its main building\nblocks are:\n1. Power circuit. Two hot-redundant input power lines make it single\n   point failure-tolerant in both nominal and redundant power lines\n2. Three accelerometer analogue signal conditioning blocks. A low-pass\n   filter with a 2 Hz cutoff is used and the analogue output from each\n   block is routed to both CDMUs. In addition, the design prevents\n   failure propagation from one conditioning chain to the others, it\n   withstands permanent short circuit conditions without any\n   degradation, and it is single point failure-tolerant toward the\n   input power supply line.\nBack-up detection of T0 is performed separately for both CDMUs by two\npairs of mechanical g-switches in case the prime CASU system is\ninoperative. The threshold values for each pair of g-switches are 5.5\ng and 1.2 g.\n \nRadial Acceleration Sensor Unit (RASU)\n--------------------------------------\n \nThe RASU measures radial acceleration at the periphery of the\nExperiment Platform. The signal is processed by the CDMU to provide\nthe Probe spin rate for insertion into the DDB distributed to\nexperiments. The RASU is designed to measure spin acceleration within\n0-120 mg with a 41.67 V/g scale factor. The design is based on CASU's\nbut includes only two accelerometers.\n \nRadar Altimeter Unit (RAU)\n--------------------------\n \nThe RAU proximity sensor uses two totally redundant altimeters\noperating with frequency-modulated carrier waves at 15.4 GHz and 15.8\nGHz to measure altitude above Titan's surface, starting from about 25\nkm. Each of the four antennas (two per altimeter) is a planar slot\nradiator array providing an antenna gain of 25 dB with a symmetrical\nfull beam width of 7.9 degrees. A continuous signal modulated in\nfrequency with a rising and falling ramp waveform is transmitted; the\nreceived signal has a similar form, but delayed by the propagation\ntime. Hence the range to target is proportional (with a linear\nfrequency modulation ramp) to the instantaneous frequency shift\nbetween the transmitted and received signals. Received signal data are\nalso provided to the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI)\nto establish Titan's surface roughness and topography.\n \nProbe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS)\n=================================\n \nThe PDRS is Huygens' telecommunications subsystem, combining the\nfunctions of RF link, data handling and communications with the\nOrbiter. It transmits science and housekeeping data from the Probe to\nthe Orbiter's PSE, which are then relayed to the Orbiter CDS via a Bus\nInterface Unit. In addition, the PDRS is responsible for TC\ndistribution from the Orbiter to the Probe by umbilical during the\nground and cruise checkouts. It comprises:\n1. two hot-redundant S-band transmitters and two circularly polarised\n   Probe Transmitting Antennas (PTAs) on the Probe\n2. a Receiver Front End (RFE) unit (enclosing two Low Noise Amplifiers\n   and a diplexer) and two Probe Support Avionics (PSA) units on the\n   Orbiter.\nThe Orbiter's High Gain Antenna (HGA) acts as the PDRS receive\nantenna. In addition, as part of the Doppler Wind Experiment (DWE),\ntwo ultra stable oscillators are available as reference signal sources\nto allow the accurate measurement of the Doppler shift in the Probe-\nOrbiter RF link: the Transmitter Ultra Stable Oscillator (TUSO) on\nHuygens and the Receiver Ultra Stable Oscillator (RUSO) on the\nOrbiter.\nThe PDRS electrical architecture is fully channelised for redundancy,\nexcept that TUSO and RUSO are connected to only one chain.\n \nProbe Support Equipment (PSE)\n-----------------------------\n \n Receiver Front End (RFE)\n ------------------------\n \nThe RFE comprises:\n- two Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) linked to the Orbiter's HGA to\n  amplify the acquired RF signal by 20 dB using two cascaded FET\n  stages\n- two RF inputs: one linked to the HGA, the other via a coupler and\n  used during checkout to link a dedicated transmitter output (on the\n  Probe) to the  RFE via the umbilical\n- a pre-selection filter (coaxial cavity type with six poles)\n- an isolator\n- an output attenuator (fixed value)\nIn addition, owing to the HGA's shared use with the Orbiter, a band\npass filter (the TX filter) and a circulator protect the LNA chain B\nby isolating the Orbiter's S-band transmissions and the Probe's S-band\nreception, which both use the HGA. These two modes are mutually\nexclusive.\n \n Probe Support Avionics (PSA)\n ----------------------------\n \nThe two RFE outputs are sent to the two PSAs, which perform detection,\nacquisition (based on a 256-point Fast Fourier Transform algorithm),\ntracking, signal demodulation and data handling & management. The PSA\ndata handling architecture is divided between analogue and digital\nsections. The analogue section performs signal down-conversion from\nS-band to the IF frequency. The IF signal is quantised and the samples\nprocessed by the digital section. The digital section performs:\n- the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) function - the signal\n  acquisition and tracking task based on FFT analysis and frequency\n  acquisition\n- the Viterbi decoding of the digital signal and delivery of the\n  decoded transfer frame to the data handling section at 8192 bit/s\n- the data handling task, which consists of:\n  - transforming the received transfer frame into a telemetry packet\n  - generating internal PSA housekeeping data (including the\n    synthesised frequency information) in a packet format\n  - controlling and managing communications with the Orbiter CDS via a\n    Bus Interface Unit\n  - distributing the telecommands from the Orbiter BIU interface.\nThe digital section is composed of the following main modules:\n- the receiver digital module, comprising the UT1750 microprocessor, 8\n  kword RAM and 8 kword PROM, and the receiver signal processing ASIC\n- the interface digital module, using GaAs devices for Numerically\n  Controlled Oscillator (NCO) and Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)\n  functions\n- the support interface circuitry module (SIC), which comprises: the 8\n  kword EEPROM to memorise software patches; the 32 kword PROM\n  containing the Support Avionics Software (SASW) and the testing,\n  telecommand, telemetry and umbilical interfaces; the MAS 281\n  microprocessor module used by the SASW\n- the BIU module that controls communications between the PSA and the\n  Orbiter's 1553 bus.\n \nProbe Transmitting Terminal (PTT)\n---------------------------------\n \nThe PTT comprises two transmitters and two Probe antennas. Each\ntransmitter includes Temperature Controlled Crystal Oscillator (TCXO)\nsynthesiser and BPSK modulator modules and a 10 W Power Amplifier\nmodule using Automatic Level Control (ALC) for 40.2 dBm nominal output\npower (end-of-life, worst-case, including ageing).\nThe reference oscillator for the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) synthesiser\nis either an (internal) Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO)\nwith a temperature compensating network or the (external) TUSO signal.\nThe selection between these reference sources is made before\nseparation from the Orbiter. The TUSO has priority unless a failure is\ndetected before separation.\nThe two transmitting antennas linked to the transmitters (dual chains\nwithout cross-coupling) are quadrifilar helix designs. The four\nspirals are fed at the bottom of the helix in phase quadrature. Left\nHand Circular Polarisation (LHCP) is used for signal transmission at\n2040 MHz and Right Hand Circular Polarisation (RHCP) for transmission\nat 2098 MHz. The minimum gain for the antennas, mounted on the Top\nPlatform, is 0.9 dB at all Probe-Orbiter aspect angles between +20\ndegrees and +60 degrees.\n \nProbe data relay link budget\n----------------------------\n \nDuring Probe descent, starting from the time of atmospheric entry as\npredicted from Orbiter trajectory and Probe separation\ncharacteristics, the Orbiter HGA is controlled to track a fixed point\non Titan's surface - the nominal touchdown point. Orbiter movement\nalong its trajectory significantly reduces the 'space loss' due to\nlink distance during the Probe's 2-2.5 h descent. However, if Huygens\ndoes not land at the nominal point, e.g. due to non-nominal entry\nparameters or zonal winds, the gain from the reduced distance is\noffset by the HGA's reduced gain from the off-axis angle of the Probe\nwith respect to the HGA's boresight axis.\nThe link budget worst cases occur at the beginning and end of mission.\nThe link design attempts to equalise the BOM/EOM signal level margins.\nAt BOM, the signal level is determined by the range, while the losses\nowing to off-axis pointing is mainly due to HGA pointing error and\nProbe delivery error (the additional dispersion arising from the entry\nphase is relatively minor). At EOM, however, the signal level is\ncritically dependent on the descent duration: the off-axis pointing\nlosses due to the Probe's lateral drift in the assumed Titan wind\nworsens with descent duration.\n \nSoftware\n========\n \nConcept\n-------\n \nThe Huygens software consists of that running in the Probe CDMS,\nreferred to as POSW, and that within the PSA on the Orbiter, referred\nto as the Support Avionics Software (SASW). The POSW output telemetry\nis relayed via the SASW and then Cassini's CDS to the ground. Two\ncopies of the data handling hardware (CDMU and PSA) run identical\ncopies of POSW and SASW.\nThe software is based on a top-down hierarchical and modular approach\nusing the Hierarchical Object-Oriented Design (HOOD) method and,\nexcept for some specific low level modules, is coded in ADA. The\nsoftware consists, as much as possible, of a collation for synchronous\nprocesses timed by a hardware reference clock (8 Hz repetition rate).\nIn order to avoid unpredictable behaviour, interrupt-driven activities\nare minimised. Such a design also allows a better observability and\nreliability of the software. Limited reprogramming accommodates\nmodifications and RAM failure recoveries.\nThe processes are designed to use data tables as much as possible.\nMission profile reconfiguration and experiment polling can therefore\nbe changed only by reprogramming these tables. This is possible via an\nEEPROM. In order to avoid a RAM modification while the software is\nrunning (which can lead to unpredictable behaviour and unnecessary\ncomplexity), direct RAM patching is forbidden. The POSW communicates\nwith the SASW in different ways depending on mission phase. Before\nProbe separation, the two software subsystems communicate via an\numbilical that provides both command and telemetry interfaces. Huygens\ncannot be commanded after separation, and telemetry is transmitted to\nthe Orbiter via the PDRS RF link.\nThe overall operational philosophy is that the software runs the\nnominal mission from power-up without checking its hardware\nenvironment or the Probe's connection or disconnection. The specific\nsoftware actions or inhibitions required for ground or flight\ncheck-out must therefore be invoked by special procedures, activated\nby the delivery of specific telecommands to the software. To achieve\nthis autonomy, POSW's inflight modification is autonomously applied at\npower-up by using a non-volatile EEPROM. At power-up, the POSW\nvalidates the CDMU EEPROM structure and then applies any software\npatches stored in the EEPROM before running the mission mode. If the\nEEPROM proves to be invalid at start-up, no patches are applied and\nthe software continues based on the software in the CDMU ROM. A number\nof other checks are also carried out at start-up (e.g. a DMA check and\na main ROM checksum), but the software will continue execution\nattempts even if the start-up checks fail.\n \nPOSW functions\n--------------\n \nThe POSW provides the following functions:\n \nProbe Mission Management\n - detecting time T0 as entry begins, based on the Central\n   Accelerometer Sensor Unit signals\n - forwarding commands at the correct times to the subsystems and\n   experiments according to the pre-defined mission timeline\n - computation of the spacecraft dynamical state from sensor readings\n - sending Descent Data Broadcasts to the experiments\n \nTelemetry Management\n - collecting and recording housekeeping data\n - generation of housekeeping packets from the housekeeping data\n - collecting experiment packets according to a pre-defined polling\n   scheme\n - transmitting transfer frames to the PDRS\n \nTelecommand Management\n - reception of TC packets from the PSE (only while attached to the\n   Orbiter)\n - execution of commands related to these TC packets\n - forwarding of commands to the experiments\n \nPOSW operations\n---------------\n \nControl of the Probe, involving the activation and forwarding of\ncommands to experiments and subsystems, is driven by a pre-defined set\nof tables, the Mission Timeline Tables (MTTs), that define the actions\nto be performed as a function of time. The pre-T0 MTT is activated at\nProbe wake-up, and controls the Probe until the post-T0 MTT is\nactivated by the POSW's detection of T0.\nThe experiments perform most of their activities autonomously based on\nthe mission phase data computed within the POSW and sent to all the\nexperiments every 2 s as a Data Descent Broadcast packet. The DDB\ncontains the time, spin rate (computed by the POSW from the RASU\nsignal or, in the event of failure, from a pre-defined look-up table)\nand altitude (initially taken from a look-up table based on the time\nelapsed since T0, but later by processing RAU data.\nThe telemetry management function involves the acquisition and\ntransmission of Probe telemetry as standard packets. Whether they are\nhousekeeping or experiment packets, they are all 126 bytes long and\nforwarded to the SASW in the form of transfer frames comprising header\ninformation followed by seven packets and then Reed-Solomon code\nwords, making a total frame size of 1024 bytes.\nHousekeeping data are acquired from the subsystems (and from the\nsoftware itself) at different rates according to a pre-determined\npacket layout, and are loaded into four packets every 16 s. One of the\npacket types is buffered and issued 6.4 min later as 'History'\nhousekeeping.\nExperiment data are acquired according to a pre-defined polling\nstrategy and  the resulting packets are loaded into the transfer\nframes. The selection of an appropriate type of telemetry packet to\ninclude in each of the frame's seven slots is managed by the polling\nsequence mechanism on a major acquisition cycle of 16 s (equal to 128\nComputer Unit Times) driven by the Polling Sequence Table (PST) and\nthe Experiment Polling Table (EPT). The PST defines if housekeeping or\nexperiment packets are to be included in the transfer frame currently\nunder construction. However, it does not select which experiment is to\nbe included. The EPT defines a prioritised scheme for the collection\nof experiment data. The table is invoked whenever the PST requests\nexperiment data for the transfer frame and is read in a cyclical\nmanner. It consists of a sequential list of the Huygens experiments,\nwith the number of occurrences of each experiment in the table\nproviding the polling priority.\nBy this method, the CDMS and the POSW are protected against failure\nmodes in the experiments that could affect the data production rates.\nEach experiment is guaranteed an opportunity to supply data at, as a\nminimum, its nominal data rate. Furthermore, this polling scheme\nautomatically optimises the data return by reallocating the TM\nresource in the absence of a 'packet ready' status flag from an\nexperiment when expected.\nThree EPTs provide different polling priorities during the descent's\nvarious stages, switching from one table to the next at a pre-set\ntime.\n \nSASW functions\n--------------\n \nThe SASW's main purpose is to provide communications between the\nOrbiter and Probe. For the SASW, there is no difference between\nreceiving Probe telemetry via the umbilical or via the RF subsystem.\nAll the differences are handled by the PDRS receiver part of the PSA\nequipment. The SASW provides the following functions:\nTelecommand Management\n - reception of TC packets from the BIU interfacing with the Orbiter\n   CDS\n - execution of commands related to these TC packets\n - forwarding TC packets to the CDMS (including experiment\n   telecommands) while attached to the Orbiter\nTelemetry Management\n - collecting PSE housekeeping data\n - transmitting PSE housekeeping packets and modified CDMS frames to\n   the Orbiter via the BIU\n \nSASW operations\n---------------\n \nCommunication between the SASW and the Orbiter CDS is via a\nMIL-STD-1553 bus using a BIU. Received telecommands are placed in BIU\nmemory for the SASW to read; the SASW places telemetry packets in BIU\nmemory for transmission by the BIU over the CDS bus. The SASW examines\nany received telecommands to determine their destination address.\nThose destined for the Probe (subsystems or experiments) are\ntransmitted over the umbilical TC link. Those for the PSA are handled\nby the SASW.\nThe SASW handles the reception of Probe telemetry via a Frame Data\nInterface (FDI). Telemetry from the Probe is transmitted to the SASW\neither by the umbilical RF link when the probe is connected or by the\nProbe Relay Link (PRL) after separation. The SASW also generates its\nown telemetry in the form of housekeeping packets, containing PSA\nstatus information, and status data collected from the PDRS subsystem.\n \n \n[From LEBRETONETAL2005]:\n \nLaunch and Flight to Saturn\n---------------------------\n \nThe Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral\ncomplex in Florida on 15 October 1997, with the probe mated onto the\nside of the orbiter. In this configuration, the orbiter provided\nelectrical power to the probe through an umbilical connection.\nCommands and data were also exchanged by this route. During the seven-\nyear journey to Saturn, the Huygens probe was subjected to 16\nin-flight checkouts to monitor the health of its subsystems and\nscientific instruments. During these in-flight tests, maintenance\nperformed and calibration data were obtained in preparation for the\nmission at Titan. The special in-flight tests designed to characterize\nthe communication radio link between the probe and the orbiter were\nespecially important.\nIn the first link test in 2000, a flaw was discovered in the design of\nthe Huygens telemetry receiver on board the orbiter that would have\nresulted in the loss of a large fraction of the Huygens probe's\nscientific data during the actual mission at Titan. Originally the\nHuygens mission was planned to be executed at the end of the first\norbit around Saturn. As a remedy to the radio receiver flaw, the first\ntwo orbits of the original mission were redesigned into three shorter\norbits that enabled the Huygens mission to be carried out on the third\norbit. The re-designed orbiter trajectory provided a Doppler shift on\nthe probe-orbiter radio link that was compatible with the well-\ncharacterized receiver performance and it also smoothly reconnected\nwith the already-designed post-Huygens orbiter four-year trajectory.\nAs a bonus, the new trajectory allowed early orbiter observations of\nTitan's upper atmosphere in order to validate the so-called Titan\natmosphere engineering model well before the Huygens probe release. It\nled to improvements in our knowledge of the structure and the\ncomposition of the upper atmosphere; in particular, it provided better\nconstraints on the argon concentration and indicated that methane was\nnot present in sufficient quantity to affect the probe entry adversely\n(that is, via excessive radiative heating). Indeed, the new mission\nscenario led to the Huygens mission being completely successful. This\nachievement was the culmination of more than 20 years of work and\nshows that the in-flight rework of the mission was necessary and was\nsuccessfully implemented.\n \nProbe release\n-------------\n \nIn preparation for releasing the probe, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft\nhad been set on a Titan-impact trajectory. Following its release, the\nHuygens probe had no manoeuvring capability and had to function\nautonomously. The Huygens release trajectory was achieved via a 'probe\ntargeting manoeuvre' with a speed adjustment of 12 m/s on 17 December\n2004, followed by a 'probe targeting clean-up manoeuvre' on 23\nDecember 2004. After the separation of the Huygens probe on 25\nDecember at 02:00 UTC, Cassini performed an 'orbiter deflection\nmanoeuvre', so that it would not crash into Titan, and a 'clean-up\nmanoeuvre' for final adjustment of its trajectory. These were on 28\nDecember 2004 and 03 January 2005 respectively and placed Cassini on\nthe correct trajectory for receiving data from the Huygens probe\nduring the descent. The responsibilities for meeting the probe's\ntrajectory requirements were shared between NASA/JPL and ESA. The\ntargeting of the probe, the NASA/JPL responsibility, was specified at\nan altitude of 1,270 km, very close to the atmosphere's upper layer,\nabove which no significant drag was expected. From this point onward\nESA was responsible for the probe's trajectory.\nThe spring-loaded Huygens separation mechanism, called the Spin Eject\nDevice, had three points of attachment to the probe. It provided a\nspeed increment relative to the orbiter of 33 cm/s. The Spin Eject\nDevice also imparted to the probe an anti-clockwise spin of 7.5 r.p.m.\n(when viewed from the orbiter). This provided inertial stability\nduring the ballistic trajectory and atmospheric entry.\n \nCoast and probe 'wake up'\n-------------------------\n \nThe Huygens probe was set on a ballistic trajectory that took a little\nover 20 days. During this time, the probe was dormant, with only three\nredundant timers counting down to a specific time programmed to end 4\nh and 23 min before the predicted entry. At this time, battery power\nwas turned on and the on-board computers, their sensors\n(accelerometers, and later in the descent the radar altimeters), and\nthe scientific instruments were energized according to the pre-\nprogrammed sequence. The probe 'woke up' as planned, at 04:41:33 UTC\non 14 January 2005. The Huygens probe's receivers on board the Cassini\norbiter were powered on from 06:50:45 to 13:37:32 UTC. The Huygens\nprobe arrived at the 1,270 km interface altitude on the predicted\ntrajectory on 14 January 2005 at 09:05:53 UTC, just a few seconds\nbefore the expected time.\n \nEntry, descent and landing\n--------------------------\n \nThe Huygens scientific mission proper took place during the entry,\ndescent, landing and post-landing phases. The descent of the probe\nthrough Titan's atmosphere was controlled by parachutes. The\naerodynamic conditions under which the main parachute had to be\ndeployed were critical. The correct instant for parachute deployment\n(mission time event, T0) was determined by the probe on-board\ncomputers that processed the measurements from the accelerometers that\nmonitored the probe's deceleration. Pyrotechnic devices fired a mortar\nthat pulled out a pilot chute, which in turn removed the probe's back\ncover and pulled out the main parachute. Then, 30 s later, the front\nshield was released. It was expected that, by this time, the probe\nwould have stabilized under the main parachute. During the entry\nphase, telemetry could not be transmitted by the probe until its back\ncover was removed. Thus, a limited set of engineering housekeeping\ndata and the HASI science accelerometer data acquired during entry was\nstored onboard the probe for transmission to the orbiter after the\nradio link was established.\nPost-flight data analysis showed that only one of the receivers\n(channel B) was phase-locked and functioned properly. Channel A had an\nanomaly that was later identified as being due to the unfortunate\nomission of the telecommand to apply power to the ultra-stable\noscillator driving the channel A receiver. Subsequent on-board events\nwere determined by the on-board software that initiated a set of\ncommands at times all related to the moment the pilot chute was\nreleased. These commands included switching on other instruments and\nthe replacement of the main parachute by a smaller 'stabiliser chute'\nafter 15 min, to ensure that the probe would reach the surface of\nTitan within the designed duration of the mission (150 min maximum for\nthe descent under parachute). The actual duration of the descent\nfollowing the T0 event was 2 h 27 min 50 s. During the first part of\nthe descent, the probe followed the nominal time-based sequence with\nthe instrument operations defined by commands in the on-board mission\ntimeline. The later part of the descent sequence was optimized by\ntaking into account the altitude measurements provided by two\nredundant radar altimeters. The altimeters were switched on 32 min\nafter T0 which corresponded to an altitude of around 60 km. They\nprovided altitude measurements to the on-board computers, which\nfiltered and compared the measurements to the predicted altitude, in\norder to exclude erratic measurements at high altitude and to provide\nreliable measured altitude information to the payload instruments.\nThis allowed for optimization of the measurements during the last part\nof the descent. The DISR measurements sequence was adjusted to\nmeasured altitude below 10 km and its lamp was switched on at 700 m\nabove the surface. The HASI and SSP instruments were set to their\nproximity and surface modes at low altitude above the surface. The\nprobe landed safely with a vertical speed of about 5 m/s and continued\nthereafter to transmit data for at least another 3 h 14 min, as\ndetermined the detection and monitoring of the probe's 2.040-GHz\ncarrier signal by the Earth-based radio telescopes. Throughout this\ntime, Cassini was oriented to receive the two incoming radio signals\nfrom the probe by continuously pointing its high gain antenna to the\npredicted Huygens landing point. After listening for the longest\npossible duration of the Huygens probe's visibility, the orbiter was\ncommanded to re-point its high gain antenna to Earth for transmission\nof the stored Huygens telemetry data. At that time, Cassini was at a\ndistance of 1,207 million kilometres (8.07 AU) from the Earth (the\none-way light-time was 67 min 6 s).\nThe data were received by the ground stations of the NASA Deep Space\nNetwork (DSN) and eventually delivered to the Huygens Probe Operations\nCentre (HPOC) in ESA's European Space Operation Centre (ESOC,\nDarmstadt, Germany) for science and engineering analysis. A 1-h margin\nwas built into the orbiter sequence to cope with uncertainties as to\nwhen the orbiter would disappear below the horizon. As seen from the\nprobe landing site, the orbiter actually set below the horizon at\n12:50:24 UTC. The probe's channel A carrier signal was still being\nreceived on Earth by radio telescopes at the time of the planned\ncompletion of the observations, at 16:00 UTC (Earth received time),\nmeaning that the probe was still operating at 14:53 UTC (Titan time).\nPost-flight analysis of the probe telemetry data indicates that the\nbatteries probably became fully discharged at about 15:10 UTC, a mere\n17 min after the Huygens radio signal was last verified on Earth. It\nis thought that the probe continued to function until the batteries\nwere exhausted.\n \nTrajectory reconstruction\n-------------------------\n \nThe probe arrived at the 1,270 km interface altitude with the spin\nimparted at separation in the anticlockwise direction. No significant\nspin modification was observed during the entry. The spin decreased\nmore than expected under the main parachute and unexpectedly changed\ndirection after 10 min. The probe continued spinning in the unexpected\ndirection (clockwise) for the rest of the descent. No explanation was\nfound for this behaviour, which is still under investigation.\nThe determination of the landing site coordinates is a complex and\niterative task and requires several assumptions. At present, the best\nestimate, based on the combined Descent Trajectory Working Group\n(DTWG), DISR and DWE reconstruction, is a latitude of 10.3 degrees\n(+-0.4 degrees) south and a longitude of 167.7 degrees (+-0.5 degrees)\n east.\n \nSummary and discussion\n----------------------\n \nThe probe and its scientific payload performed close to and sometimes\nbeyond expectations. The in-flight modifications of the Huygens part\nof the mission, to cope with the receiver design flaw detected in\n2000, was highly successful. The loss of data on channel A, due to a\ntelecommand omission, was largely compensated for by the flawless\ntransmission on channel B, with not a single bit missing until the\nradio link signal-to-noise decreased below the design limit of 3.3 dB,\nin the last 10 min of surface transmission, and the fact that the DWE\nscientific objectives were largely recovered by using data from the\nEarth-based radio telescope observations.\nDeceleration and load levels measured during the hypersonic entry were\nwell within the expected limits and all prime systems worked well,\nwith no need to have recourse to the two back-up systems (g-switches)\nthat had also been activated. The parachute performance was within the\nexpected envelope, although the descent time, at slightly less than\n2 h 28 min, was only just within the predicted envelope of 2 h 15 min\n+- 15 min. The descent was rather smooth under the main parachute but\nrougher than anticipated during the first hour under the last\nparachute. A detailed profile of the atmosphere is being worked out\nfrom the scientific measurements to allow the parachute performance to\nbe studied in detail.\nAn exciting scientific data set was returned by the Huygens probe,\noffering a new view of Titan, which appears to have an extraordinarily\nEarth-like meteorology, geology and fluvial activity (in which methane\nwould play the role of water on Earth). While many of Earth's familiar\ngeophysical processes appear to occur on Titan, the chemistry involved\nis quite different. Instead of liquid water, Titan has liquid methane.\nInstead of silicate rocks, Titan has frozen water ice. Instead of\ndirt, Titan has hydrocarbon particles settling out of the atmosphere.\nTitan is an extraordinary world having Earth-like geophysical\nprocesses operating on exotic materials under very alien conditions.\nThe Huygens data set provides the ground-truth reference for the\ninterpretation of the remote observations of the Huygens landing site\nby orbiter instruments, and more generally the global observations of\nTitan. Future observations of the Huygens landing site by Cassini\nshould allow us to place the local Huygens maps into their global\ncontext and are expected to tell us whether changes can be seen.\nProbe-orbiter synergistic studies are a key aspect for achieving the\nvery ambitious Cassini-Huygens objectives at Titan.\n \nChannel A anomaly\n-----------------\n \nThe mission had two probe-orbiter radio link channels, which are\nreferred to as channels A and B. Both transmitters (onboard the probe)\nand both receivers (onboard Cassini) were equipped with a temperature-\ncontrolled crystal oscillator (TCXO) which provided sufficient\nfrequency stability (~10^-6) fot telemetry. One of the channels\n(channel A) was additionally equipped with ultra-stable oscillators\n(USOs) that were needed for the Doppler Wind Experiment (DWE), which\nrequired a stable carrier frequency signal. As part of finalising the\nHuygens probe's configuration for its mission, it had been decided to\nuse the channel A USOs instead of the TCXOs because the performance of\nthe USOs had been very satisfactory during the seven-year cruise.\nThe command to power on the USO on the receiver side was unfortunately\nomitted. As a result, the Channel A receiver onboard Cassini did not\nhave a reference oscillator and was unable to lock on to the Huygens\nsignal. Consequently, the frequency measurements for the Doppler Wind\nExperiment (DWE), together with the non-redundant telemetry data on\nChannel A, were lost. The loss of the DWE data was, fortunately,\nlargely mitigated by the radio astronomy segment of the mission\nconsisting of a network of ground-based radio telescopes. The Channel\nA carrier signal, driven by the probe's USO, was received by 15 radio\ntelescopes and tracked for post-flight data analysis. Real-time\nDoppler tracking information was obtained through the two largest\ntelescopes of the network: the NRAO R. C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope\n(West Virginia, USA) and the CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope (New South\nWales, Australia). Both telescopes were equipped with NASA Deep Space\nNetwork's Radio Science Receivers (RSR) operated by the Radio Science\nGroup of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition, the other 13\nradio telescopes recorded the Channel A carrier signal for\nnon-real-time Doppler and VLBI analysis.\n \n \nHuygens mission timeline on 14 January 2005\n===========================================\n \nActivity                             Time (UTC)   Mission time, t - t0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nProbe power-on                           04:41:18          -4:29:03\nProbe support avionics power-on          06:50:45          -2:19:56\nArrival at interface altitude (1,270 km) 09:05:53          -0:04:28\nt0 (start of the descent sequence)       09:10:21           0:00:00\nMain parachute deployment                09:10:23           0:00:02\nHeat shield separation                   09:10:53           0:00:32\nTransmitter ON                           09:11:06           0:00:45\nGCMS inlet cap jettison                  09:11:11           0:00:50\nGCMS outlet cap jettison                 09:11:19           0:00:58\nHASI boom deployment (latest)            09:11:23           0:01:02\nDISR cover jettison                      09:11:27           0:01:06\nACP inlet cap jettison                   09:12:51           0:01:30\nStabilizer parachute deployment          09:25:21           0:15:00\nRadar altimeter power-on                 09:42:17           0:31:56\nDISR surface lamp on                     11:36:06           2:25:45\nSurface impact                           11:38:11           2:27:50\nEnd of Cassini-probe link                12:50:24           3:40:03\nProbe support avionics power-off         13:37:32           4:27:11\nLast channel A carrier signal reception ~14:53              5:42:39\n by Earth-based radio telescopes         16:00 (ERT)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe second column gives the time in UTC (for the probe), while the\nthird column gives the time relative to t0, where t0 is the official\nstart of the descent associated with the pilot chute deployment event.","tools":[5]},{"tags":["tartar","targ","rar"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.orex","display_name":"OSIRIS-REx","display_description":"The Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification \n    Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft is a derivative \n    of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Mars Atmosphere and\n    Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft, leveraging the key heritage\n    design components of these two missions.
